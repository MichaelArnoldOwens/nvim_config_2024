### TODO
- change my <leader>rp command to run the right workflow for the current file i'm working on. for example, if i'm working on a cpp file, it should compile and run the binary. right now it only runs python files
- make the indent guides darker
- add dracula theme / theme switcher that randomizes it each day - https://github.com/maxmx03/dracula.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file
